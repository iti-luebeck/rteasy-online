# Backend

The backend contains the core logic for RTeasy. Here you can find among others the parser, compiler and simulator. All code in here is frontend agnostic and can be used from a graphical as well as from a console-based interface. The [API Docs](https://iti-luebeck.github.io/rteasy-online/dev/docs/backend/rt_easy) for the backend are built automatically.
