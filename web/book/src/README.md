RTeasy-Online is a development environment for the register transfer language RTeasy. With RTeasy it is possible to design and simulate register transfer programs.

A register transfer language (RT language) is used to describe the hardware using
register operations. The following basic pattern is used for the operations:

```
Z <- f(X_1, X_2, ..., X_m)
```

where `Z`, `X_1`, `X_2`, ... , `X_m` represent identifiers for registers and the function `f` describes the operation. The result is then stored in `Z`.

This book contains a tutorial for RTeasy-Online and RTeasy as well as a list and explanation of all possible errors that can occur during compilation.
