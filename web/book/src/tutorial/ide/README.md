# IDE User Guide

The RTeasy-Online IDE has two different modes. On the one hand there is the editing mode, in which the program is developed. On the other hand there is the simulation mode, where you can execute the program and display the register, bus, register array and memory contents. In this mode, you cannot modify the program. In both modes all views can be moved around freely.

At the start you are always in the editing mode.
